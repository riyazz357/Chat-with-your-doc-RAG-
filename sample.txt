The era of modern space exploration began with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957. This event sparked the Space Race, a period of intense competition between the United States and the Soviet Union.

The Apollo program, managed by NASA, was designed to land humans on the Moon and bring them safely back to Earth. The program's most famous mission, Apollo 11, achieved this goal on July 20, 1969, when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the lunar surface. The famous quote from this mission is "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

In contrast to crewed missions, robotic probes have explored the far reaches of our solar system. The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes, launched in 1977, have traveled farther than any other human-made object and are now in interstellar space. They carry a Golden Record, a message from humanity to the cosmos.

Mars exploration has been a key focus, with numerous rovers studying its surface. The Perseverance rover, which landed in 2021, is searching for signs of ancient microbial life and collecting rock samples for a future return mission to Earth. Its primary mission is astrobiological.
